## ISSUES:

### ‚úÖ RESOLVED ISSUES:

1. **[‚úÖ FIXED]** Streamlit Widget Key Conflict in Document Upload:
   - **Issue:** "The widget with key "main_navigation" was created with a default value but also had its value set via the Session State API."
   - **Root Cause:** Conflicting default value (index parameter) with session state management
   - **Solution:** Removed index parameter from selectbox, allowing session state to handle defaults
   - **Files Modified:** `frontend/streamlit_app.py` (line 1285)
   - **Status:** ‚úÖ Resolved and tested successfully

### üìã ACTIVE ISSUES:

1. for some reasion i'm seeing a success message, yet the json that is showed in the frontend after uploading is showing the Document ID as "NULL": (i thout this was already working, it might be we just arent reading it properly?)

I. **[üîç MONITORING]** Backend Logs Analysis:
   - **Current Status:** Backend healthy (Status 200), but some warnings present
   - **Observed Warnings:** 
     - PyTorch version 2.1+ required (current: 2.0.1)
     - SentenceTransformers not available (handled with fallback)
   - **Mitigation:** Fallback mechanisms implemented and working
   - **Action Required:** None - system operational with graceful degradation

### üéØ NEXT AREAS TO MONITOR:

II. **Performance Optimization:** Monitor TF-IDF fallback performance vs SentenceTransformers
III. **Dependency Updates:** Consider PyTorch upgrade when compatible versions available
IV. **User Experience:** Continue monitoring for any new UI/UX issues
