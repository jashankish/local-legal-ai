## Implementation Notes

### Development Approach
This phased approach allows for:
- **Incremental Development:** Each phase builds on the previous
- **Testing at Each Stage:** Comprehensive validation before proceeding
- **Modular Architecture:** Components can be developed and tested independently
- **Flexible Deployment:** Can deploy partial functionality while continuing development

### Current Status Summary
- **Phase 1:** âœ… Fully operational core infrastructure
- **Phase 2:** âœ… Fully operational RAG pipeline with TF-IDF embedder
- **Phase 3:** âœ… Fully operational frontend development
- **Phase 4:** ðŸ“‹ Planned for future enhancement

### Technical Stack Confirmed
- **Backend:** FastAPI + ChromaDB + TF-IDF embedder
- **Authentication:** JWT with admin/user roles
- **Document Processing:** Legal-aware chunking + TF-IDF embeddings
- **Query System:** Semantic search + context-based responses
- **Frontend:** Streamlit (Phase 3)

### Next Steps
1. **Start Phase 4:** Plan and design advanced features
2. **Implement Advanced Features:** Legal precedent linking and citation tracking
3. **Test Advanced Features:** User acceptance testing
