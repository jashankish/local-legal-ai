Action Plan for Implementing Local Legal AI
Phase 1: Core Infrastructure Setup
Complete Backend Foundation
Implement config.py with environment variables and settings
Set up auth.py with JWT authentication
Create basic API endpoints for health checks and status
Vector Store Implementation
Complete chromadb_setup.py for document storage
Implement document ingestion and indexing functionality

Model Integration
Configure vllm_launcher.sh to properly launch LLaMA 3
Test model inference with simple prompts
Create API endpoints for model interaction
Phase 2: RAG Pipeline Development
Embedding System
Implement embedder.py for document embedding
Test embedding generation and storage
Optimize for legal document formats (PDFs, contracts, etc.)
RAG Implementation
Complete rag_pipeline.py with retrieval and generation logic
Implement context window management for legal documents
Create API endpoints for RAG-based Q&A
Testing with Legal Documents
Test with sample legal documents
Optimize retrieval for legal terminology
Fine-tune context handling for legal citations
Phase 3: Frontend Development

Implement Slack integration for alerts
System Integration
Connect all components (backend, frontend, vector store, model)
Implement end-to-end testing
Optimize performance
Deployment
Set up production environment
Configure monitoring and logging
Create backup and recovery procedures
Phase 6: Documentation & Refinement
User Documentation
Create user guides
Document API endpoints
Provide examples and use cases
System Documentation
Document architecture
Create setup and maintenance guides
Document security protocols
Performance Optimization
Optimize query performance
Improve response times
Scale for larger document collections
Implementation Tips
Start with a minimal viable product (MVP) focusing on core RAG functionality
Use mock data and simplified components for early testing
Implement continuous integration for automated testing
Regular security audits throughout development
Gather feedback from legal professionals during development
This phased approach allows for incremental development and testing, ensuring each component works correctly before moving to the next phase. It also provides opportunities for feedback and adjustments throughout the development process.
