Action Plan for Implementing Local Legal AI

## Phase 1: Core Infrastructure Setup ✅ COMPLETED

### Complete Backend Foundation ✅
- ✅ Implement config.py with environment variables and settings
- ✅ Set up auth.py with JWT authentication  
- ✅ Create basic API endpoints for health checks and status

### Vector Store Implementation ✅
- ✅ Complete chromadb_setup.py for document storage
- ✅ Implement document ingestion and indexing functionality
- ✅ Create API endpoints for document management

### Model Integration ⚠️ PARTIAL
- ✅ Configure vllm_launcher.sh to properly launch LLaMA 3
- ⏳ Test model inference with simple prompts (Phase 2)
- ⏳ Create API endpoints for model interaction (Phase 2)

**Phase 1 Status: OPERATIONAL** 
- ✅ FastAPI server running on http://localhost:8000
- ✅ ChromaDB embedded client working
- ✅ Authentication system with JWT tokens
- ✅ All 4/4 tests passing

## Phase 2: RAG Pipeline Development 🚧 IN PROGRESS

### Embedding System
- ⏳ Implement embedder.py for document embedding
- ⏳ Test embedding generation and storage
- ⏳ Optimize for legal document formats (PDFs, contracts, etc.)

### RAG Implementation  
- ⏳ Complete rag_pipeline.py with retrieval and generation logic
- ⏳ Implement context window management for legal documents
- ⏳ Create API endpoints for RAG-based Q&A

### Testing with Legal Documents
- ⏳ Test with sample legal documents
- ⏳ Optimize retrieval for legal terminology
- ⏳ Fine-tune context handling for legal citations

## Phase 3: Frontend Development

### Streamlit UI
- Implement streamlit_app.py with chat interface
- Create document upload functionality
- Build search and filtering capabilities

### User Experience
- Implement responsive design
- Add loading states and error handling
- Create document visualization components

### Authentication Integration
- Connect frontend to backend auth system
- Implement login/logout functionality
- Add user session management

## Phase 4: Security & Monitoring

### Audit Logging
- Implement audit_log.py for activity tracking
- Create logging for document access and queries
- Set up alerting for suspicious activities

### Access Control
- Implement IP whitelisting
- Set up role-based access control
- Create admin interface for user management

### Security Testing
- Perform penetration testing
- Implement security best practices
- Document security measures

## Phase 5: Automation & Integration

### n8n Workflows
- Define workflows.json for automation
- Set up file drop monitoring
- Implement Slack integration for alerts

### System Integration
- Connect all components (backend, frontend, vector store, model)
- Implement end-to-end testing
- Optimize performance

### Deployment
- Set up production environment
- Configure monitoring and logging
- Create backup and recovery procedures

## Phase 6: Documentation & Refinement

### User Documentation
- Create user guides
- Document API endpoints
- Provide examples and use cases

### System Documentation
- Document architecture
- Create setup and maintenance guides
- Document security protocols

### Performance Optimization
- Optimize query performance
- Improve response times
- Scale for larger document collections

## Implementation Tips
- Start with a minimal viable product (MVP) focusing on core RAG functionality
- Use mock data and simplified components for early testing
- Implement continuous integration for automated testing
- Regular security audits throughout development
- Gather feedback from legal professionals during development

This phased approach allows for incremental development and testing, ensuring each component works correctly before moving to the next phase. It also provides opportunities for feedback and adjustments throughout the development process.
